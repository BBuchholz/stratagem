    Every Learning Participant (LP) is expected to choose one of two options.
  </p>
  <p class="technical">
    The first option is to link up with an existing Workshop Portfolio site (as they can support multiple LPs), and this is the preferred options for most LPs as tha Myriad EcoSystem Arrangement is built around the idea of Creative Collectives centered around Collaboration.
  </p>
  <p class="technical">
    The second option is to create their own, which can be easily cloned from template and customized in a single session. It is recommended that LPs interested in this option seek out the Advisement ov another LP currently maintaining a Node themselves to learn how they work.

    SYW5 is a PASSCODE which is a fundamental concept within tha Myriad EcoSystem Arrangement. Passcodes will often work at multiple sites and the same codes will often reveal different things at those different sites. Often a Card will  accompany a Passcode, clicking the card will sometimes take you elsewhere, it is usually useful to try the passcode that brought you to a site at the new site you find yourself at, as orientation materials will be frequently located behind that passcode for ease of use with newcomers

    Proceed to BAOLG and enter this same code to see
    the work in progress
